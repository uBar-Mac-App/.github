## What is uBar?

**uBar** is a highly functional Dock replacement that transforms your workflow and how you manage windows in macOS. Instead of the traditional icon-only Dock, uBar brings a familiar, clean, and information-rich taskbar UI that lets you see **active windows**, **labels**, **progress indicators**, **active app states**, and **real-time previews** — all while staying compact and efficient.

It’s designed for users who work with many windows at once: editors, developers, product teams, researchers, browsers-with-200-tabs people — anyone who needs more than an icon grid at the bottom of the screen.

uBar provides instant visibility into what’s open, which windows belong to which app, and lets you navigate with a single click. Pin favorites, filter tasks, show hidden apps, switch workspaces, and even monitor app usage in real-time. The app can live on any side of the screen, supports multiple monitors, and scales elegantly on ultra-wide setups.

A lot of users install uBar as a **macOS uBar alternative** to traditional docks or use it alongside launchers like Alfred, Raycast, or Spotlight, because it solves different pain points: **actual window management at a glance**. It supports Intel devices, Apple Silicon devices, and newer builds like **uBar4** with deeper customization options.

If you want a serious **u bar mac** experience instead of the stock Dock, uBar is one of the most refined and stable solutions in the entire category.
